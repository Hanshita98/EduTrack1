EduTrack - Java Android sample project (SQLite local storage)

How to use:
1. Unzip EduTrack.zip
2. Open the folder in Android Studio (File -> Open... -> EduTrack)
3. Let Android Studio sync Gradle (you may need an internet connection to download Gradle plugin/libs)
4. Run on emulator or device

Notes:
- This is a lightweight skeleton made to run locally. If Android Studio complains about Gradle plugin version, update the classpath in build.gradle or use a compatible Android Studio version.
- If you want a fully bundled Gradle wrapper, tell me and I will add it.
